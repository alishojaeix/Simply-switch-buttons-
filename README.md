# LeafKey, TopoKey, and PandaKey - 3D Keyboard Showcase

This project showcases three unique 3D keyboard designs using `model-viewer` to render interactive 3D models in a web environment. The keyboards are presented in a visually appealing card layout with hover effects and color customization options.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Models**: Each keyboard is displayed as a 3D model that users can interact with.
- **Color Customization**: Users can change the color scheme of the keyboards by clicking on the color options provided.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Hover Effects**: The 3D models rotate slightly when the user hovers over the cards, providing a dynamic experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Handling interactivity and model manipulation.
- **Model-Viewer**: A web component for rendering 3D models in the browser.

## Models

1. **LeafKey**: A keyboard that brings the tranquility of the forest to your fingertips.
2. **TopoKey**: A custom illuminated keyboard with neon topology mapped out in every key.
3. **PandaKey**: A playful keyboard design inspired by pandas.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-keyboard-showcase.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 3d-keyboard-showcase
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

- **Hover over the cards** to see the 3D models rotate.
- **Click on the color options** below each keyboard to change its color scheme.

## Customization

You can customize the models and colors by modifying the `index.html` and `style.css` files. The `model-viewer` component allows you to load different 3D models by changing the `src` attribute.
